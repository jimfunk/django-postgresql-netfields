- 0.7
  * Added support for Django 1.10
  * Added __overlaps lookup (Emre Hasegeli)
  * Fixed __in lookups of empty lists (Simeon J Morgan)

- 0.6
  * Removed support for Django 1.7
  * MACAddressField fixes and cleanups (Andreas Rammhold)
  * Support for ArrayField from django.contrib.postgres. Note that the types
    returned in the array will not be the proper types returned by the
    non-array fields in Django < 1.9.6 due to
    https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25143

- 0.5.3
  * Add max_prefixlen and min_prefixlen lookups (Hugo Castilho)
  * Changed field subclassing to Django 1.8+ format (Antwan86)
  * Use the ipaddress module instead of py2-ipaddress for Python 2.x
  * Standard lookups now inherit from base lookups

- 0.5.2
  * Support for Django 1.9
  * Invalid lookups on Django < 1.9 will now raise FieldError or
    NotImplementedError to match Django 1.9

- 0.5.1
  * Fixed form validation error messages to avoid confusion
  * Updated README to reflect the change to the ipaddress module

- 0.5
  * Switched InetAddressField and CidrAddressField from netaddr to the
    ipaddress module found in core Python >= 3.3. For Python < 3 the backported
    py2-ipaddress module will be used. The API of these objects are mostly
    compatible with the netaddr API and do not suffer from some subtle issues
    that netaddr objects have when used in Django forms. Most applications
    should not require any adjustments as a result of this change

- 0.4.1
  * Added serializer fields for Django REST Framework. Thanks to Brandon
    Cazander
  * Added a store_prefix_length argument to InetAddressField. If set to False
    an IPAddress will be returned instead of an IPNetwork. If there is a prefix
    length before conversion, it will be truncated

- 0.4
  * Return IPNetwork object from InetAddressField instead of IPAddress. This
    better matches the capabilities of the underlying inet type since it can
    contain an embedded prefix length/netmask. This change may affect some
    users
  * Added __family lookups for filtering by address family, eg:
    'filter(ip__family=4)' to select only IPv4 addresses. Thanks to leifurhauks
  * Removed support for Django < 1.7

- 0.3.1
  * Fix CidrAddressField in lookups with single-item lists #39
  * Fix validation of CIDR with bits to right of mask #19

- 0.3
  * Added support for Django 1.7/1.8 (Antwan86, smclenithan)
  * Added support for Python 3.x
  * Removed support for Django 1.4

- 0.2.2
  * Support for Django 1.6 (Jay McEntire)

- 0.2.1
  * Fix net_contained lookups in InetAddressField

- 0.2
  * Fix IP type casting in form fields
  * Add South introspection rules
  * Expand tests for form fields and MAC addresses
  * Use netaddr instead of IPy for address representation. New requirement of
    netaddr module. This change affects backwards compatibility
  * New maintainer James Oakley <jfunk@funktronics.ca>
