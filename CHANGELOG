- 1.0.0
  * Rewrote the REST framework fields to conform to recommendations
    + The proper types are now set on unsaved models and passed to validators.
      Any validators or pre-save code that assumes the values are strings may
      need to be adjusted
    + Simplified the validation error messages
  * Fix deprecation warnings (Mike Lane)
  * Test against Django 2.2 (Øyvind Kolbu)

- 0.10.0
  * Added support for __host lookups, for matching the host part of an address
    regardless of prefix length

- 0.9.0
  * Added support for Django 2.1
  * Some Django 3.0 compatibility
  * BREAKING CHANGE: If using ArrayAgg to return groups of network addresses,
    None values will be included as per the Django documentation. Previously,
    the None values were filtered out, but that appears to have been a mistake
    in the implementation. If your application depends on the filtered None
    values, it will need to be updated accordingly
  * Prefer "error_messages" rather than "default_error_messages" in form
    fields (Shintaro Kojima)

- 0.8
  * Added support for Django 2.0

- 0.7.2
  * Fix issue where prefetch_related returns empty querysets (Jay McEntire)
  * Improve validation error messages to include the underlying error (Diego
    Gaustein)
  * Strip extraneous whitespace around form inputs

- 0.7.1
  * Fix issue with recent psycopg2 releases (Jonas Genannt)
  * Add a lookup for exact CIDR prefix length (Joey Wilhelm)
  * Use proper unicode type when casting ipaddress/ipnetwork objects for
    queries
  * Support array aggregation with netfields (orf)
  * compatibility with template based widgets (Leo Honkanen)

- 0.7
  * Added support for Django 1.10
  * Added __overlaps lookup (Emre Hasegeli)
  * Fixed __in lookups of empty lists (Simeon J Morgan)

- 0.6
  * Removed support for Django 1.7
  * MACAddressField fixes and cleanups (Andreas Rammhold)
  * Support for ArrayField from django.contrib.postgres. Note that the types
    returned in the array will not be the proper types returned by the
    non-array fields in Django < 1.9.6 due to
    https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/25143

- 0.5.3
  * Add max_prefixlen and min_prefixlen lookups (Hugo Castilho)
  * Changed field subclassing to Django 1.8+ format (Antwan86)
  * Use the ipaddress module instead of py2-ipaddress for Python 2.x
  * Standard lookups now inherit from base lookups

- 0.5.2
  * Support for Django 1.9
  * Invalid lookups on Django < 1.9 will now raise FieldError or
    NotImplementedError to match Django 1.9

- 0.5.1
  * Fixed form validation error messages to avoid confusion
  * Updated README to reflect the change to the ipaddress module

- 0.5
  * Switched InetAddressField and CidrAddressField from netaddr to the
    ipaddress module found in core Python >= 3.3. For Python < 3 the backported
    py2-ipaddress module will be used. The API of these objects are mostly
    compatible with the netaddr API and do not suffer from some subtle issues
    that netaddr objects have when used in Django forms. Most applications
    should not require any adjustments as a result of this change

- 0.4.1
  * Added serializer fields for Django REST Framework. Thanks to Brandon
    Cazander
  * Added a store_prefix_length argument to InetAddressField. If set to False
    an IPAddress will be returned instead of an IPNetwork. If there is a prefix
    length before conversion, it will be truncated

- 0.4
  * Return IPNetwork object from InetAddressField instead of IPAddress. This
    better matches the capabilities of the underlying inet type since it can
    contain an embedded prefix length/netmask. This change may affect some
    users
  * Added __family lookups for filtering by address family, eg:
    'filter(ip__family=4)' to select only IPv4 addresses. Thanks to leifurhauks
  * Removed support for Django < 1.7

- 0.3.1
  * Fix CidrAddressField in lookups with single-item lists #39
  * Fix validation of CIDR with bits to right of mask #19

- 0.3
  * Added support for Django 1.7/1.8 (Antwan86, smclenithan)
  * Added support for Python 3.x
  * Removed support for Django 1.4

- 0.2.2
  * Support for Django 1.6 (Jay McEntire)

- 0.2.1
  * Fix net_contained lookups in InetAddressField

- 0.2
  * Fix IP type casting in form fields
  * Add South introspection rules
  * Expand tests for form fields and MAC addresses
  * Use netaddr instead of IPy for address representation. New requirement of
    netaddr module. This change affects backwards compatibility
  * New maintainer James Oakley <jfunk@funktronics.ca>
